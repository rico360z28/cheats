    # cp Images/SPS08080ca /var/lib/tftpboot
    # cp Boot/mnz10113.bin /var/lib/tftpboot
      Change permissions on files so TFTPD user can see them
    # chmod 766 /var/lib/tftpboot/*.bin
    
  Backup running config of switch for firmware upgrade
    From terminal will have to telnet to switch
    Use IP Address taht matches your switch
    # telnet 192.168.0.3 23
      Login with usename and Password
      enable Admin mode
    telnet@Ruckus>enable
      telnet@Ruckus#
    #configure terminal
      telnet@Ruckus(config)#
      
      The following commands will be repeated for the ports you want active
      For this example the uplink port is on C1 and POE devices are on 1/1/1 - 1/1/22
      Ports 23 and 24 are not used. (Maybe used for additionl non POE devices)
      
    #interface ethernet 1/1/1
    #inline power power-by-class 4
    #inline power power-limit 16800
    
      Repeat for 1/1/1 - 1/1/18
      Change power-limit for 1/1/19 - 1/1/22 to 6000 to allow for bringing up 1/1/22
