      The following commands will be repeated for the ports you want active
      For this example the uplink port is on C1 and POE devices are on 1/1/1 - 1/1/22
      Ports 23 and 24 are not used. (Maybe used for additionl non POE devices)
      
    #interface ethernet 1/1/1
    #inline power power-by-class 4
    #inline power power-limit 16800
    
      Repeat for 1/1/1 - 1/1/22
