The OpenVPN scripts included in the tutorial worked great.: https://docs.hak5.org/hc/en-us/articles/360010554013-OpenVPN-Payload
Only problem I had with SSH on my VPS to the VPNd clients was with MTU
On the server conf for OpenVPN make the following changes:
for tun-mtu and for mssfix
***********
proto udp
dev tun
tun-mtu 1500
mssfix 1300
***********

After the change on my server side i was able to use this fun little device to my content!
